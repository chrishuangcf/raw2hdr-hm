# 🌟 **Turn RAW Photos Into Stunning HDR Magic — Instantly**

Take your flat, gray RAW files and transform them into **true HDR HEIC** images that shine on iPhone and XDR displays. No complicated workflow. No color-science degree required. Just **real HDR** — with brilliant highlights, rich shadows, and up to **2000 nits** of dynamic range.

Your photo starts dim, then *brightens into HDR* right before your eyes. It feels like watching the picture come alive.

## ✨ **HDR That Looks Like Real Life**

Your RAW data is full of hidden detail. Our engine unlocks it using the same color science behind cinema workflows:

* Linear RAW → PQ Rec.2020 wide gamut
* Output as **10-bit HEIC**, the format iPhone understands natively

The result?
Photos with **far more depth, color, and realism** than traditional JPEGs.

## 🔎 **SDR vs HDR: See the Difference**

When you export an HDR image at a **higher nit value** (for example 1600 or 2000 nits), the image is given **more “headroom” for highlights**. That means the very bright parts get extra space at the top of the HDR range so they don’t clip.

But here’s what this does to the histogram:

* The histogram shows how bright the pixels *appear* on your screen.
* If you reserve more space for highlights, the **whole curve moves left** — meaning the image looks darker on screens that cannot reach that brightness.

**Simple idea:**
More highlight headroom → histogram shifts left → image looks darker.

This is normal HDR behavior.

You aren’t losing brightness — you’re gaining more room for bright detail to exist without blowing out.

* Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) shows limited brightness on a HDR capable display.
* HDR reveals the full highlight and shadow detail your camera captured.

## 💡 **Smart Brightness (Nit) Control**

Export for any display:

* **1600 nits** → Perfect for iPhone 16 Pro
* **500 nits** → Ideal for older monitors
* **2000 nits** → Maximum highlight headroom

Higher nit values save more details in the brightest areas — making your HDR more flexible for editing.

## 🎛️ **Simple Tools. Professional Results.**

Because RAW is naturally “flat,” you get essential, clean adjustments:

* Exposure
* White Balance
* Contrast
* Highlight Control

Designed to let the HDR engine do the heavy lifting.

## 📲 **Export, Share, Enjoy**

Because camera manufacturers do not publish their full color-science pipelines, it’s not possible to perfectly recreate each camera’s exact color rendering. Instead, this app performs a direct RAW-to-HDR colorspace transformation, giving you a clean and accurate foundation. You can then apply basic adjustments—contrast, brightness, saturation, and more—to shape the final look.
Be mindful that HDR can be easily “overcooked” if pushed too far. The built-in preview helps guide your edits, but because it does not have access to the camera’s proprietary color profiles, the preview will appear more neutral and less vibrant than what your camera might normally produce. This is expected.
Once exported as an HDR HEIC file, the proper colorspace transformation is applied, and the final image will look significantly more vivid and natural on HDR-capable displays. The preview system cannot display this exact colorspace, so think of it as a helpful approximation—not the final result.
The app also includes gentle optional adjustments for color, saturation, and contrast inspired by community-driven open-source profiles. These are not official manufacturer color palettes, but they can add a subtle “finishing touch” to your output when desired.

* True HDR HEIC
* Automatic HDR playback on Apple devices
* Optional SDR JPEG included for compatibility

Your RAW. Your HDR. Your way.
Bring every photo to life with light, color, and clarity your camera always had — but your screen couldn’t show… until now.

## **Currently this is a beta version**

* The beta version outputs at 25% of the original RAW resolution, giving you a free way to explore the app while development continues.
LUT-based color filters are not included in the beta.
* Technically, most LUTs are designed for Rec.709, which typically operates in an 8-bit SDR colorspace. To apply these LUTs correctly, the RAW image would need to be converted down into an 8-bit RGB format before the LUT can be used.
Once the image is reduced to 8-bit, the HDR (10-bit) highlight and color information is lost, making it impossible to generate a true HDR result from LUT-processed data.
Because of this limitation, LUTs wouldn’t produce real HDR effects—they would only serve as a creative “fun” filter rather than an HDR-grade color tool—so this feature is not enabled at this time.
